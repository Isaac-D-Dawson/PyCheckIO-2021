#You are given a text, which contains different English letters and punctuation symbols. You should find the most frequent letter in the text. The letter returned must be in lower case.
#While checking for the most wanted letter, casing does not matter, so for the purpose of your search, "A" == "a". Make sure you do not count punctuation symbols, digits and whitespaces, only letters.
#If you have two or more letters with the same frequency , then return the letter which comes first in the Latin alphabet. For example -- "one" contains "o", "n", "e" only once for each, thus we choose "e".

#Input: A text for analysis as a string.
#Output: The most frequent letter in lower case as a string.
#Precondition :
#A text contains only ASCII symbols.
#0 < len(text) â‰¤ 10^5
