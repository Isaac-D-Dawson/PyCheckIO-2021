#Version 1.0. A future mission will use a more advanced version of this puzzle, and will have a V2 revision solution.

# You are given a string and you have to find its first word.
# This is a simplified version of the First Word mission, which can be solved later.
# The input string consists of only English letters and spaces.
# There aren’t any spaces at the beginning and the end of the string.

# Input: A string.
# Output: A string.
